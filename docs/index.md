### What is Discord?

Discord is a popular online communication platform. Users can interact with each other via text, voice, or video - either privately or as part of a "server". Discord servers are managed communities of users, generally dedicated to a particular topic or interest. You can find a Discord server for just about anything!

### Discord Benefits

- **Inclusive & Cost Effective**: Discord is free, well-supported, and can run on just about any desktop or mobile platform. This makes it an ideal communication platform for the CodingNomads community. 
- **Immediate**: The CodingNomads Discord server provides a central hub for instant communication with other members of the community. 
- **Structured by Topic**: CodingNomads' server is structured into various channels with purposefully-designated topics. This ensures that requests for help target an audience that is most qualified to contribute meaningful assistance.
- **Multiple Access Levels**: Channels are also divided into groups. General channels are accessible by all members of the community, and as such are community-supported. Mentored students have access to additional channels which are actively supported by the CodingNomads mentorship team.
- **Various 1:1 Support Methods**: The server also provides dedicated 1-on-1 DM channels for communication between students and mentors, along with voice calls and screen-sharing capabilities for recurring and impromptu support sessions.

### Getting Started with Discord

#### TL;DR Quick Start Guide

Below are the quick steps to getting started on CodingNomads' Discord Server. Continue reading below for more detailed instructions, as well as helpful tips for using Discord!

1. [Download and install](https://discord.com/download) the Discord app on your machine.
2. Sign up and/or sign in to Discord.
3. Click [this link](https://discord.gg/MrwdByvMaz) to join CodingNomads Discord server.
4. When you first enter the server, you’ll be asked to read and agree to our Code of Conduct. After which, you’ll be automatically admitted to the server. 
5. Say hi in the `#general` channel on Discord! :) 

#### 1. Install Discord - Detailed Guide

Download and install the [desktop client](https://discord.com/download) for the best experience. On initial launch, you can create an account.

#### 2. Sign Up and/or Sign In to Discord

You can use a single account to join multiple servers, while setting a different [server nickname](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames) for each. This allows you to use your real name on the CodingNomads server, and a pseudonym on others. Discord also supports multiple user accounts and offers simple account switching within the app if that works better for you.

#### 3. Join CodingNomads Server

Once your account is set up, [click this link](https://discord.gg/amhafdRMhc) to join the CodingNomads server.

### Using Discord Channels

If you are currently a paying member or mentored student, within minutes additional channels will automatically unlock. If they do not, send a quick message in `#ask-questions` and support staff will get it sorted out right away. Now that you've joined the server, you can start chatting right away. You'll notice the `#entry` channel is now gone from your channel list and a few new channels are available, including:

* `about-us`: This channel offers additional information about CodingNomads and the Discord server. --**Start here**--

* `ask-questions`: A place for the general public to ask non-technical questions about CodingNomads.

* `#general`: This is a great place for discussion on just about anything (mostly non-technical), where we also share our weekly accomplishments!

* `#general-...` channels: For **technical questions**, there are a series of `#general-java/python/etc` channels for language or topic-specific support. These channels are community supported, so feel free to jump in and **offer a helping hand if you can**! The favor will come back your way the next time you get stuck on a tricky problem and need a little advice.

* `#introduce-yourself`: Head over to the `#introduce-yourself` channel and share a short message with your motivations & goals. You can include reasons why you've decided to learn programming and become a part of the CodingNomads community. We are happy to have you here!

* `#interest-management`: Add topics of interest to your profile. This allows members with similar interests more easily find each other, communicate, and ask for or offer support.

* `#your-name` channel: Mentored students have access to additional channels for support and dedicated 1-on-1 mentor communication, which are titled with your first and last name. Your mentor can walk you through using the Discord voice channel and screen sharing features for your sessions.

* `#coding-memes`: Looking for a laugh? Our coding memes channel has been a long time staple in the community for (family-friendly) fun. Feel free to post things that community members can relate to, just be sure to keep it clean! &#128540;

### Posting Code

Writing a message that contains code with Discord is easy using backticks. For small one-liners, or method and variable names you can use single backticks (`):

>What exactly does the \`shrink()` method do?

Renders as: What exactly does the `shrink()` method do?

>\`Hey, I'm a piece of code!\`
>
Renders as: `Hey, I'm a piece of code!`

For larger blocks of code like complete methods, classes, etc., surround the code with triple backticks (```) for a better result:

```
public int shrink(int number) {
    return number - 1;
}
```

### Direct Messages

Sending a DM is easy, just click the user you want to message in a channel's user list, then type your message. 

![Sending a DM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodingNomads/static/main/discord/discord-dm.png?raw=true)

This is where things are a bit different with Discord.  Once you've sent a DM, you'll find the conversation has moved outside of the CodingNomads server, and is now in your **Direct Messages** section of Discord. This is not a problem, the conversation can continue as normal here, but keep in mind that a person might now be identified by their **username**, rather than their CodingNomads server **nickname**. In that case, you'll see an "AKA" next to their username indicating the nickname that you know them by inside of the server.

 ![AKA Nickname](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodingNomads/static/main/discord/discord-dm-user.png?raw=true)

### Message History & Access

Discord messages in most channels do not expire. This offers the opportunity to search and reference previously posted questions, solutions, and other helpful information at a later time. Next time you're about to post a request for help, give it a try!

One exception is a mentored student's dedicated mentor support channel. When your mentorship program comes to an end, this channel will be deleted and all history will be lost. If you would like to archive these messages before the channel is deleted, please let a staff member know.

Students who have enrolled in CodingNomads 1-on-1 mentorship program (mentored students) will retain lifetime access to "Member Support" category channels even after their mentorship period ends. However, mentored students will lose access to the "Mentored Support" category channels and 1-on-1 mentor support channels after their mentorship period ends. 

Students who have subscribed to one or more courses, but have not enrolled in CodingNomads mentorship program (members), will retain access to "Member Support" category channels only while their membership subscription is active. When a member cancels their monthly subscription, they will lose access to the "Member Support" channels on the Discord server, but will retain access to all public channels and categories.

### Thanks

Hope this guide has helped you get a bit more acquainted with Discord, looking forward to seeing everyone there! 

Need help? If you were able to join the Discord server, but are unable to access additional channels - you can contact support staff by posting a question in the `#ask-questions` channel. If that is not an option, send a quick note to: admin@codingnomads.co and we'll get you fixed up asap.
